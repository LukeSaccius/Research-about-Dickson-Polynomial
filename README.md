# Research on Dickson Polynomial Value Sets

This project contains scripts and research notes for analyzing the value sets of reversed Dickson polynomials, `D_n(x, 1)`, over finite fields `F_p`.

## Objective

The primary goal is to analyze the cardinality (the number of unique values) of these value sets for various primes `p` and indices `n`, and to identify number-theoretic patterns.

## Key Findings

The research uncovered and numerically verified three distinct formulas for the indices `n` that produce a value set of cardinality 2. For any given prime `p > 3`, the set of these indices is:

1.  **Formula 1:** `n = (p^2 + 1) / 2`
2.  **Formula 2:** `n = p^2 - 1`
3.  **Formula 3:** `n = (p^2 + 2p - 1) / 2`

All three formulas were verified with **RMSE = 0** (exact match) across the dataset for primes up to 97.

### General Polynomial Equation

A unified polynomial equation that is satisfied by all three indices is:

```
(n - (p^2 + 1)/2) × (n - (p^2 - 1)) × (n - (p^2 + 2p - 1)/2) = 0
```

For any prime `p > 3`, the three roots of this cubic equation in `n` are precisely the indices that yield a value set of cardinality 2.

## How to Run

### 1. Generate Data
```bash
python Test.py
```
This will produce:
- `reversed_dickson_values.csv` - Raw data for all primes and indices
- `reversed_dickson_values_by_cardinality.csv` - Data sorted by cardinality

### 2. Verify Formulas

**Derive formulas using polynomial regression:**
```bash
python derive_all_formulas.py
```

**Run exact verification (RMSE=0):**
```bash
python verify_all_formulas_exact.py
```

### 3. Visualize Data

**Generate interactive plot:**
```bash
python plot_cardinality_2_interactive.py
```
This creates `cardinality_2_indices_interactive.html` with hover details and log/linear scale toggle.

### 4. Additional Analysis Scripts

- `analyze_cardinality_2.py` - Initial pattern discovery
- `verify_cardinality_2_patterns.py` - Pattern verification
- `print_cardinality_2_indices.py` - Print all cardinality=2 indices grouped by prime
